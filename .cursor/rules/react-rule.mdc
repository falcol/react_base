# ‚úÖ GENERAL RULES FOR SENIOR REACT PROJECTS

## üéØ GOALS AND RECOMMENDED TOOLS

| Goals | Recommended Tools |
|----------|------------------|
| Routing + URL sync | ‚úÖ React Router (`useSearchParams`) |
| Data query (search/table) | ‚úÖ TanStack Query (`useQuery`) |
| Debounce input | ‚úÖ `use-debounce`, `lodash.debounce`, or custom |
| Form control | ‚úÖ React Hook Form |
| Table UI | ‚úÖ Ant Design Table, Pagination |
| Memoization | React.memo, useMemo, useCallback|
| State on reload/back | ‚úÖ Sync with URL + use TanStack Query cache |
| Lazy Loading/Suspense| React.lazy, Suspense|

- Avoid anonymous functions in props if not needed.
- placeholderData in TanStack Query to improve perceived performance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è PRINCIPLES WHEN CODING

### 1. **Always use the correct version declared in `package.json`**
- Do not use features that are not supported in the current version.

- If you need to use a new API, you must upgrade to a valid version.

### 2. **Do not edit unrelated code**
- When fixing bugs or refactoring, only edit the affected area.

- Absolutely do not delete or rewrite logic that is running smoothly.

### 3. **Code must be standard, clear and optimized according to the new standard**
- Use React 19+ features if supported (ex: `useTransition`, `Suspense`, `lazy()`).

- Use `useCallback`, `useMemo` in the right place to avoid unnecessary re-rendering.

- Prioritize React Hook Form + Zod/Yup for powerful validation.

### 4. **State management must have a clear strategy**
- Separate: local UI state uses `useState`, server state uses TanStack Query.
- Do not push everything to Context or Redux if not necessary.

### 5. **Synchronize URL and State**
- Search form or data table must keep state via URL.
- When reloading/backing/forwarding, all data and form must remain the same.

### 6. **Component must be separated reasonably**
- UI is separated from API processing logic.
- Table component, Form component should be reusable.

### 7. **Do not hard-code URL/API**
- Use separate configuration (ex: axios instance) or environment variable `.env`.
